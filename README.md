# Student Performance Data Analysis

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of student academic performance
to identify key factors that influence exam results using data science techniques.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze student performance data using Python.
Through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, the project extracts
meaningful insights related to academic outcomes.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains academic performance records of 1000 students with the following attributes:

- Gender  
- Race/Ethnicity  
- Parental level of education  
- Lunch type  
- Test preparation course  
- Math score  
- Reading score  
- Writing score  

The dataset does not contain any missing values, making it suitable for exploratory analysis.
